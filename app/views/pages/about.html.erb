    <h2>The Big Problem</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Itâ€™s almost a daily and a troubling affair to see so many people around you, strive on one meal a day or no meal at all. Makes you wonder if there is enough food for everyone. In fact there is!</p>

    <p class="text-center">Everyday tons of edible food is thrown away by restaurants, organizations and individual households. This food goes straight into the dumps and left to decompose.  And for a slight moment to even think we do not have enough food for everyone is a cardinal sin. So to confront this injustice of food waste and hunger we attempt to create a bridge between the two thriving social issues.</p>

    <h2>The Big Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-center">We are a platform for food distribution and collection. We route you to the nearest restaurant or an organization to collect full square meals and excess food. This food is then redistributed to the hungry by various Non-Profits.</p>
